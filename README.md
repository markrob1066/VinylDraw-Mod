# vinyl_draw

"Vinyl Draw" takes as input a bitmap image file, extracts an annular section, the dimensions of which can be specified, and produces a sound file. If things go well, when the sound file is recorded to analogue disc (gramophone record) using the same speed and pitch as those specified in the program, the extracted section of the original image should be discernible as a pattern in the inscribed groove.
