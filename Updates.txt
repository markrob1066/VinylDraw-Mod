2022-02-22 Reworked colour processing to use Hue, Saturation, Luminosity for creating the section of waveform for a point in the image. The Hue value (0 - 360) is mapped logarithmically to a frequency between the two values specified by the user in the GUI. Either the Luminosity or the Saturation value (both 0 - 100) can be selected to determine the amplitude of the wave. This seems to work better than using separate sections of waveform at frequencies for R, G, B. The resulting sound file is also slightly less harsh to listen to!
Updated Help panel to reflect this.
Also fixed several bugs: 
- Resolved problem caused by the presence of extra bytes (up to 3) in pixel rows.
- Fixed colour table pick-up for sub-16-bit images.
- Removed option of 16-bit BMP processing: options are now for 1-, 4-, 8- and 24-bit BMPs.
